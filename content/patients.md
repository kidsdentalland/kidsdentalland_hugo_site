As a courtesy we accept most insurances, all major credit cards, and can set you up for

Emergencies
In the event of an emergency that may be life threatening, immediately “DIAL 911”, or proceed
to your local emergency room or urgent care facility.
If you encounter a dental emergency that is not life threatening, here a few tips for managing the
crisis until you are able to visit your dentist:
1. Remain calm and attempt to stop any bleeding.
2. Protect the area where the trauma has occurred.
3. Refrain from taking aspirin or ibuprofen, as they may worsen the bleeding.
4. Take acetaminophen for any pain.
Call your local office for an Emergency appointment to seek immediate attention.
