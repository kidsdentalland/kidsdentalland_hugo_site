Dental Health
At Kids Dental Land, we believe dental health is a serious matter, which is why our team is here
to provide you and your child with best practices for maintaining optimal dental health for their
lifetime. Our team wanted to share their best tips and recommendations for all facets of your
child’s oral health, including how to brush, caring for braces, and other dental questions most
families ask about.
Dental Care
At Kids Dental Land,, we teach our young patients to create an early practice of preventative
dental habits. It’s our belief that educating them to solve problems before they happen is key.
That means they should establish a routine that has them brushing and flossing two to three
times each and every day - preferably with an electric toothbrush - for at least two minutes. An
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Water Flosser
Water flossers are an effective tool to help fight issues on the tooth’s surface, like plaque. More
importantly, they are also the best defense against debris and food particles that end up stuck
between teeth and around braces. The water flosser shoots a pulsing stream of water that when
aimed between and around the tooth, forces any matter out from the natural crevice. It should
be a part of every child’s daily brushing and flossing routine.
Dental Education
Parents must be involved in teaching their child proper dental hygiene habits. At Dentistry 4 Kids
we recommend starting as early as possible by teaching your child about the importance of
brushing and flossing every day. As a parent you should communicate the value of a proper and
healthy diet filled with nutritious foods. Lastly, we recommend visiting the dentist with your child
twice per year, so they understand the value of regular dental check-ups. Get your child on the
path to positive dental health habits to ensure a lifetime of great health.
Bi-Annual Exams
Establishing a habit of seeing the dentist twice per year is important for your child. These visits
will help them remain free of cavities by reducing plaque build-up on their teeth. It is beneficial
for them to receive regular exams by a licensed Pediatric Dentist in order to evaluate their
needs for fluoride, sealants or other considerations.
Fluoride
Selecting a toothpaste with fluoride is critical to early stage dental care, which helps to prevent
decay and cavities. The benefit of being a patient with Dentistry 4 Kids is access to licensed
Pediatric Dentists that can educate parents about the proper time to introduce fluoride into a
child’s oral health care routine.
Sealants
The act of sealing the surface of at risk teeth to prevent cavities and decay has many benefits.
Your child’s six and twelve year permanent molars are the most susceptible to early stage
challenges.
Children in Braces

If your child is required to receive orthodontic treatment it is critical to keep their braces, teeth
and gums clean. At Dentistry 4 Kids our licensed Orthodontists educate each patient about
proper oral hygiene. Specifically, for children with braces it is important to avoid certain foods
that may stick to the appliance, brackets and wires. The build up of plaque is another concern
for children wearing braces, because if it is left on their teeth or braces, they may experience
swelling of the gums, bad breath, tooth discoloring or decay.
Please observe the following recommendations from Kids Dental Land Chief of Orthodontics:
Foods to Avoid
Children with braces should avoid foods that are sticky, hard or chewy. Consistent with standard
positive health habits, all children should only consume sugary foods and drinks in moderation.
The foods listed here are commonly known to cause damage to braces, and therefore should be
avoided:
• Gum
• Whole Apples
• Nuts
• Caramel
• Hard Candy
• Taffy
• Corn Chips
• Popcorn
Brushing & Flossing
Your child’s teeth will be more difficult to clean once they are in an appliance and wearing
braces. We recommend to have them follow a strict regimen of brushing and flossing two to
three times per day, including while at school. Flossing with braces may be a challenge at first
due to the wires. Encourage your child to exercise patients, and they will have the hang of it in
no time.
