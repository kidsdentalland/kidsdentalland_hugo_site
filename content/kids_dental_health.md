KIDS DENTISTRY
Kids Dental land conducts comprehensive examinations, including digital x-rays, and then
diagnoses problems to prevent them from becoming serious. On a typical office visit to see one
of our Doctors, your child will receive a dental cleaning and guidance on proper oral hygiene
techniques.
Many parents wonder when to bring their child for the first time. The American Academy of
Pediatric Dentistry recommends an initial dental examination by a child’s first birthday. This
allows for an evaluation by a dentist where they may create an individualized preventive
program to be followed. Many organizations believe in treating dental disease, but at Kids
Dental Land it is our practice to teach dental health care for the best long-term benefit. Early
detection is critical in the process of promoting a healthy oral cavity for life. Prevention is still the
number one form of treatment by eliminating problems before they occur. Please visit our Kids
Dental Land office, so we may care for your child’s smile.
Sealants: Sealants help protect the chewing surfaces of healthy back teeth and are made of
clear or shaded plastic. Fitting your child with sealants is a simple and painless visit to the
dentist. Evidence shows that children with sealants end up with 50% less tooth decay following
the age of fifteen.
Fluoride Supplements: Dentists maintain that children older than six months should receive
supplements if their drinking water does not contain the necessary amount of fluoride. Fluoride
supplements taken by infants have been shown to reduce tooth decay by as much as 50%.
Proper dosages are based on age and the amount of fluoride present in your drinking water. At
Kids Dental Land we recommend evaluating whether or not your water is providing the right
amount of fluoride to your child.
SEDATION DENTISTRY
Sedation dentistry uses medication to help children relax during many dental procedures. It's
often referred to as "sleep dentistry," although that's not entirely accurate as often times your
child is awake, with the exception of those who are under general anesthesia.
Here are the various levels of Sedation Dentistry:
Oral sedation -- Child is awake and relaxed, may not remember much of the procedure.
General anesthesia -- Child is completely unconscious.
Regardless of which type of sedation your child receives, typically they’ll need a local anesthetic
-- numbing medication at the site where the dentist is working in the mouth to relieve pain if the
procedure causes any discomfort.
General Anesthesia: Many parents feel Anesthesia is usually the most comfortable option for
children that have extreme apprehension, disabilities, or require extensive treatment. At Kids
Dental Land we will provide either in-office or out-patient facility care under general anesthesia.
Our care will be supported by licensed anesthesiologists who are dedicated to your child’s
comfort and safety.

Nitrous Oxide: Children who experience anxiety due to the sights, sounds, or sensations of
dental treatment may respond more positively with the use of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is
perhaps the safest sedative in dentistry. It can reduce anxiety and gagging, and make long
appointments more bearable for your child. The child remains fully conscious during treatment
and recovery is rapid.
